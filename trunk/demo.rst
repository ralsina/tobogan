It's nerd-oriented
------------------

It's trivial to display source code, with
proper syntax highlighting.
  
.. code-block:: python

  from base64 import *
  def myFirstFunction():
  	print b64decode ('YnllIHdvcmxkIQ==')
  
Even for things like shell sessions.
Dammit, I am a nerd, I will try to add every nerd
feature I deem cool.


It does things simply
---------------------

This is a subtitle?
+++++++++++++++++++

Wanna show a flickr photo?

.. code-block:: rst

  .. flickr:: myPhotoTitle
  
How about using openomy.com to share your files?
And whatever else you can think of, it probably
**can** be done.

It's very easy to extend
------------------------

Really. It's simple python code.

* The module to do syntax highlighting has 41 lines.

* The module to do dynamic animated menus has 103.

* The module to do calendars has 72.

If there is a python module or web service to do what you
want, hooking it into BartleBlog is simple.

And it has kickass features
---------------------------

Like online, embedded, animated slideshows! Like this one!
Done with 65 lines of simple almost-plain-text markup! 
Ok, it's not fully implemented yet, because it needs some manual
code, but the hard part is done!

Or automatic SVN changelog display ( I admit that's *somewhat niche* ;-))

Now, who else has that kind of thing?
